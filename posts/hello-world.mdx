Welcome to my blog. I'm Osman — ML engineer, based in Istanbul.

I've been meaning to start writing for a while. This is me finally doing it.

## What I'll write about

Mostly things I find interesting at the intersection of machine learning, systems, and engineering craft. Practical stuff — things I've built, problems I've solved, tools I like.

No grand theory. Just honest engineering notes.

More soon.
